#### 1. Stopwatch.
- resets time, gained XP, gold and COTO when clicked
- gray is the time in the zone, it is updated automatically
#### 2. Adventurer XP
- shows the total amount if you have not received experience
- also show level without buffs and progress to the next level
#### 3. Producer XP
- same as adventurer xp
#### 4. Toggle visibility of Stats, Buffs and Notify windows.
#### 5. Filter Stats by name (lua patterns available)
#### 6. Check stat or buff so that it is visible in the Notify window
- unlike buffs, stats will not be updated unless checked (there are just a lot of them)
#### 7. Filter Buffs by description (lua patterns available)
#### 8. Notify (will change)
- show gold and coto gained during the timer period
- show checked stats and buffs



## TODO
- Containers min_size
    > For large lists (like Stats), detected minimum size has a big impact on performance!
